# image-labeler

~~[Live Site](http://image-labeler.herokuapp.com)~~ Unfortunately, 500px has taken down its API, making this project currently unusable. I'll need to find another free and safe image provider for this game to be functional.

## Description

This is a web app inspired by Google's now defunct image labeler. It pairs two users to label random images, and awards points based on the number of similar labels they choose.

## Technical

- Built with node.js and express, and socketio
- Pulls images from the 500px.com API
- Currently uses heroku for hosting
